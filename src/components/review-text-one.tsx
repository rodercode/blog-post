      At first I was afraid, I was petrified – I kept thinking "how could
      Respawn follow up on its outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order?" But
      then I spent so many nights playing the sequel finding out how they got it
      right and Cal Kestis grew strong, and I learned how to get along. And now
      we’re back, in outer space… okay, okay, don’t leave! I’ll stop. The point
      is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps,
      vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a
      Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman:
      Arkham City to Fallen Order’s Arkham Asylum. And much like the Arkham
      games did for Batman, nothing else convincingly captures playing as a
      Force user quite as well as this. Especially considering that there’s no
      reason not to go back and play Fallen Order before starting Survivor if
      you haven’t, I greatly appreciate that the sequel starts you out with most
      of the powers and upgrades that Cal had already acquired – there’s no
      corny amnesia or other, “Oh no, my powers are gone!” gimmick to make you
      re-learn how to double-jump or use Force push, and no Jawas snuck up and
      stole away the climbing claws that make scaling walls much faster or the
      Scomp Link that lets BD-1 hack things. Outside of having to earn back your
      healing canisters and life and Force bar extensions, this is more or less
      Cal as we left him five years prior. So we’re already off to an exciting
      running start when things kick off with a brief caper on Imperial
      Coruscant that calls back to A New Hope before making a thrilling escape.
      You’re quickly thrown right back into Force-pushing Storm Troopers off of
      ledges and chaining together movement tricks like wall-running, climbing,
      swinging, and sliding down ramps. And that’s just the beginning – the
      Spider-Man-style grapple (which only works on pre-designated points) is
      introduced before you leave Coruscant, and the unlocks keep coming from
      there on at a rewarding pace. When you unlock the mid-air dash ability to
      pair with your double-jump, things really take off – you can cover such
      crazy distances without touching the ground, changing directions twice to
      reach things around corners, that I had to completely rethink what was
      possible. It’s not as though Survivor invented the air dash, but Respawn
      makes excellent use of it, further flexing those Titanfall muscles. Moving
      around is definitely satisfying but lightsabers are, of course, the stars
      of the war. Survivor kicks up the excellent dueling from Fallen Order by
      several notches with five different fighting stances that are all
      brilliantly animated to create some of the flashiest and fiercest Star
      Wars melee battles I’ve ever seen. You don’t even have to be all that good
      at nailing the timing of strikes, parries, and dodges for fights to look
      spectacular and smooth as you carve a swath through enemies (but if you
      are it looks even cooler), and the fact that arms and legs can now
      sometimes get severed from Storm Troopers and other humanoids – not just
      droids and creatures, who get absolutely shredded – makes it feel more
      gratifyingly powerful than ever during kill animations.
