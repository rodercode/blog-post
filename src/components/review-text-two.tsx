        After dabbling in the single, double-bladed, and dual-wielding stances
        that carry over from Fallen Order, I settled on the two new ones: the
        Kylo Ren-inspired Crossguard style and the hybrid Blaster stance that
        answers the question of “wouldn’t it be cool if Han Solo were also a
        Jedi?” The Crossguard treats your lightsaber as a slow and heavy
        broadsword that’s great for hammering a stunned target into the floor,
        while the latter equips you with a sidearm to dispatch small enemies
        without having to close the gap and sure makes short work of
        flamethrower troopers, packs of animals, or others who like to get in
        close. It’s, quite literally, a blast. Of course, once I unlocked the
        ability to throw my Crossguard saber to hit enemies a little farther
        away I felt like either stance was capable of taking down just about any
        enemy when needed and settled in for the ride. These sabers pair nicely
        with the expanded set of Force powers that allow you to do things like
        pull in an entire group of enemies close before executing a spinning
        slash to cut them all down like blades of grass. You can only equip two
        of the five stances at any given time, which at first seemed
        artificially limiting – and it is, when you think about it – but I came
        to appreciate it because it gave my version of Cal more personality as a
        fighter. You can, of course, swap out your stances at any meditation
        circle, but especially in the early hours you only have so many skill
        points to go around (and only one free respec). Each stance has its own
        skill tree, so you’re encouraged to specialize, and by the time I
        reached the second half of the story I had my clear favorites, and no
        regrets.
